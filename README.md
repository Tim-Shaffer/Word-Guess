Word Guess Game

The Word Guess game was built with an **"Everybody Loves Raymond"** theme.

The object of the game is to guess the word associated with the popular show by selecting one letter at a time. 

The game starts with an image of the major characters in the show at the top with the *theme* playing in the background. 
Pressing the Spacebar will cause the programming to randomly select a word from a hard coded list that fans of the show should recognize.

After the hidden word is display, the user will guess letters to see if he/she can figure out the word.  If the letter is found in the hidden word, the letter will be revealed in all the positions that it is found.  If the letter is **NOT** found in the hidden word, the letter will show in a separate list and the number of remaining guesses will be reduced by one.  

The game continues until the word is revealed or there are no guesses remaining.  When the word is guessed, a **WIN** is tallied.  When the word is *not* guessed in the number of tries allowed, a **loss** is tallied and the word revealed in **CAPS**.  Each win or loss is notified by a separate sound playing.  **Wins** are notified with a clip of Robert Barone saying the famous **"Everybody Loves Raymond"** line.  A **Loss** is notified with a clip of Raymond Barone saying **"No, No, No ... No"**. 

Since the words to be guessed are selected randomly from a provided list, it is possible to get the same word more than once while playing the game.
